**Pyplan Core** provides a Python development environment intended for easily creating and deploying data analytics apps. Different than a Jupyter Notebook, where code is structured as a list of sentences, in Pyplan code is contained in nodes that work as calculation steps, organized in a hierarchical influence diagram. Nodes can be evaluated, and its result inspected through a console output or rendered as a table or graph.
